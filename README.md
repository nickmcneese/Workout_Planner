# Workout_Planner
Allows you to keep track of progress and set goals. Uses file serialization in order to
store previously written data. Made this to keep track of my progress at the gym more efficiently than a spreadsheet. Will add exporting to jar file later.

First, select whether you want to create a new workout plan or select one of your
already loaded plans. Then either select a workout by typing the name of that workout,
remove a workout from your plan by typing 'remove' + the workout name, or add a workout
by typing 'add'+ workout name. 

After selecting a workout, you can see your last saved progress on said workout as well as a goal that you want to achieve. Once you have achieved that goal, the program will prompt you to set a new goal as well as the next progression if applicable.
